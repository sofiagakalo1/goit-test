<h2>How to use:</h2>

1. Choose the necessary page from the header navigation: home or tweets.

2. On the tweets page, you can see different cards with other users' tweets. You can start following them by clicking the "FOLLOW" button, and then you can see the quantity of followers changing. If you don't want to follow them anymore, you can click the "FOLLOWING" button.

3. Clicking the "Load more" button will fetch new users' tweets for you to see. Every time you click this button, you will receive new tweet cards unless there are no more users in our database.

4. You can filter all users' tweet cards by clicking on one of the filters: "show all," "follow," or "following."

    By choosing the "Show all" filter, you can see all users, whether you are following them or not.
    By choosing the "Follow" filter, you can see all users you are not following yet.
    By choosing the "Following" filter, you can see only users you are already following.

5. Reloading the page will save all the results.

6. That's it! Have a nice experience.
